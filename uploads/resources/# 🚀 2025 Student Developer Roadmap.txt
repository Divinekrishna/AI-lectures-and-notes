# 🚀 2025 Student Developer Roadmap: ML & DSA
**Goal:** Hackathon Wins, Connections, and Internship Offer by Summer.
**Current Status:** Endsems ongoing (ends Jan 2).
**Background:** ML Basics done, DSA Theory done.

---

## 🗓️ PHASE 0: The "Exam Gap" Strategy (Now – Jan 2)
**Constraint:** 1 Hour per day maximum.
**Focus:** Maintenance & Setup (Low Stress).

* **Daily Routine (1 Hour):**
    * [ ] **20 Mins (DSA):** Solve 1 "Easy" problem on LeetCode/GFG.
        * *Topic:* Arrays or Strings.
        * *Goal:* Just keep the muscle memory alive. Don't tackle hard graphs yet.
    * [ ] **40 Mins (ML Prep):**
        * Day 1: Create a GitHub account (if not done) & install Git.
        * Day 2: Download "TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset" from Kaggle.
        * Day 3: Watch a 20-min tutorial on "Streamlit for Python".
        * Day 4: Explore "Unstop" and "Devfolio" websites for upcoming hackathons in Jan.

    * *Step 3:* Wrap it in Streamlit (Dropdown menu -> Show Recommendations).
    * *Step 4:* **DEPLOY** it on Streamlit Cloud (Free).

### 🟠 Week 3 (Jan 17 - Jan 23): Hackathon Mode
* **DSA Focus:** Recursion, Linked Lists.
* **Hackathon Task:**
    * Register for an *online* hackathon on Unstop/Devfolio.
    * Even if you don't win, submit a project.
    * *Goal:* Add the "Hackathon Participant" badge to your LinkedIn.

### 🔴 Week 4 (Jan 24 - Jan 31): Branding & Resume
* **DSA Focus:** Trees (BST), Introduction to Graphs (BFS/DFS).
* **Career Task:**
    * **Resume Update:** Add a "Projects" section. Link your deployed Movie Recommender.
    * **LinkedIn:** Post a video demo of your project. Tag 5 connections.
    * **Apply:** Send 5 cold emails/messages to startup founders or professors for internships.

## 🗓️ PHASE 2: Semester Maintenance (Feb Onwards)
**Goal:** Consistency without burnout.
This is a fantastic adjustment. It makes your schedule packed but highly productive. By Jan 20, you will have your ML basics sorted, a SWOC contribution (hopefully), and be ready to dive into JavaScript.

Here is your **Revised "Sprint" Roadmap (Jan 13 - Jan 20)**.

### **The Daily Routine (The "45-Minute Rule")**

Before you touch ML or Web, pay your "DSA Tax."

* **Slot 1 (Morning/Start):** **45 Mins DSA**. (1 LeetCode Problem).
* **Slot 2 (Deep Work):** **2-3 Hours**. (PyTorch/ML Learning).
* **Slot 3 (Application):** **1 Hour**. (SWOC Contribution/hunting).

---

### **Day-by-Day Plan**

#### **Day 1: Jan 13 (Today) - The Setup**

* **DSA (45m):** Topic: **Arrays**.
* *Problem:* "Move Zeroes" (LeetCode 283). Focus on moving elements without making a copy.


* **ML/PyTorch:**
* **Goal:** Understand **Tensors**. (They are just Numpy arrays that run on GPU).
* **Task:** Install PyTorch. Create random tensors, reshape them (`.view()`), and do basic math (add, multiply).
* **Resource:** `torch.tensor`, `torch.randn`.


* **SWOC:** Join the Discord servers of 2-3 organizations. Introduce yourself.

#### **Day 2: Jan 14 - The Magic of Autograd**

* **DSA (45m):** Topic: **Strings**.
* *Problem:* "Valid Anagram" (LeetCode 242). Use a Hash Map (dictionary).


* **ML/PyTorch:**
* **Goal:** Understand **Gradient Descent**.
* **Concept:** How `loss.backward()` calculates gradients automatically. You don't need to do calculus; PyTorch does it for you.
* **Task:** Implement "Linear Regression" from scratch using PyTorch (predicting `y = 2x + 1`).



#### **Day 3: Jan 15 - The Training Loop (Crucial)**

* **DSA (45m):** Topic: **Two Pointers**.
* *Problem:* "Squares of a Sorted Array" (LeetCode 977).


* **ML/PyTorch:**
* **Goal:** Memorize the 5 Steps.
* **Code:**
1. `optimizer.zero_grad()`
2. `output = model(input)` (Forward pass)
3. `loss = criterion(output, target)` (Calculate error)
4. `loss.backward()` (Calculate gradients)
5. `optimizer.step()` (Update weights)


* **Task:** Train a tiny network on dummy data.



#### **Day 4: Jan 16 - Computer Vision Basics (CNNs)**

* **DSA (45m):** Topic: **Sliding Window**.
* *Problem:* "Max Sum Subarray of size K" (The one we discussed).


* **ML/PyTorch:**
* **Goal:** Move beyond numbers to **Images**.
* **Task:** Load the **MNIST Dataset** (Handwritten digits) using `torchvision`.
* **Project:** Build a simple classifier that predicts if an image is a '7' or a '1'.



#### **Day 5: Jan 17 - SWOC Action Day**

* **DSA (45m):** Topic: **Binary Search**.
* *Problem:* "Binary Search" (LeetCode 704) - Standard implementation.


* **SWOC Focus:**
* **Goal:** Make a Pull Request (PR).
* **Strategy:** Go to a Python-based repo. Look for a folder called `scripts` or `utils`.
* **Action:** Write a script (e.g., "Image Resizer using Pillow" or "CSV to JSON converter") and submit it.
* *Note:* Even if it's simple, getting a PR merged boosts confidence.



#### **Day 6: Jan 18 - Finishing Touches**

* **DSA (45m):** Topic: **Recursion**.
* *Problem:* "Fibonacci Number" (LeetCode 509). Try both recursion and loop.


* **ML/PyTorch:**
* **Task:** Save your trained model (`torch.save`) and write a Python script to load it and make a prediction on a new image.
* **Why?** This "Model Inference" script is what you will connect to your website later.

### **The "One-Shot" Web Revision (Jan 19)**

This is your **HTML/CSS Refresh Day**. Do not spend weeks on this. You just need to recall the layout systems.

* **Morning (HTML5):**
* Revise Semantic Tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`). Don't just use `div` everywhere.
* Forms: `<input>`, `<button>`, `<form>`.


* **Afternoon (CSS Flexbox):**
* This is the most important thing for React.
* **Game:** Play **Flexbox Froggy** (online game) to revise `justify-content` and `align-items`.


* **Evening (CSS Grid):**
* Play **Grid Garden**. Understand the difference between Flex (1D) and Grid (2D).


* **Night Project:**
* Build a **"Portfolio Landing Page"**.
* **Requirements:** A Photo (round), a Bio, and a Grid of "Skills" cards. Responsive (works on mobile).
